being positive has become a new form of moral correctness in a survey I recently conducted with over 70000 people I found that 1/3 of us a third either judge ourselves for having so-called bad emotions like sadness anger or even grief or actively try to push aside these feelings we do this not only ourselves but also to people we love like our children we may inadvertently shame them out of emotions seen as negative jump to solution and fail to help them to see these emotions as inherently valuable normal natural emotions are now seen as good or bad but when we push aside normal emotions to embrace false positivity we lose our capacity to develop skills to deal with the world as it is not as we wish it to be I've had hundreds of people tell me what they don't want to feel they say things like I don't want to try because I don't want to feel disappointed or I just want this feeling to go away I understand I said them but you have dead people's goals only dead people never get unwanted or inconvenience by their feelings only dead people never get stressed never get broken hearts never experienced the disappointment that comes with failure tough emotions are part of our contract with life you don't get to have a meaningful career or raise a family or leave the world a better place without stress and discomfort discomfort is the price of admission to a meaningful life
