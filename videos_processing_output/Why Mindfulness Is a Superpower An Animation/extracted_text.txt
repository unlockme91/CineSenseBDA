you may have heard this word mindfulness it's become something of a buzz phrase of late I'm going to give you one simple serviceable definition which is this mindfulness is the ability to know what's happening in your head and any given moment without getting carried away by it imagine how useful this could be just as an example driving down the road and said to cut you off in traffic how do you normally react I think most of us we normally react by having a thought which is I'm pissed and then what happens next you immediately habitually reflexively inhabit that thought you actually become pissed there's no buffer between the stimulus and your reaction with just a little bit of mindfulness in that same situation you might notice my chest is buzzing my ears are turning red I'm having a Starburst of self-righteous thoughts I'm getting angry but you don't necessarily have to act on it and chase that person down the road screaming at them with your kids in the back of the car thinking you've gone nuts now you might be thinking don't I need to get angry sometimes but probably not as much as you think the proposition here is not that you should be rendered by mindfulness into some lifeless non-judgmental blob the proposition is that you should learn how to respond wisely to things that happened to you rather than just reacting blindly and that my friends is a superpower how do you get it the way to get it is through meditation I believe that meditation and mindfulness are the next big public health Revolution and the 1940s if you told somebody you were going running they would have said who's chasing you but then what happened next the scientist swooped in they showed that physical exercises really good for you and now all of us do it and if we don't we feel guilty about it and that's where I think we're headed with mindfulness and meditation it's going to join the Pantheon of no brainers like brushing your teeth eating well and taking the meds your doctor prescribed for you let me just close by saying mindfulness is not going to solve all of your problems it's not going to render your life a non-stop Parade of unicorns and Rainbows nonetheless this is a superpower and one that is accessible by you immediately
