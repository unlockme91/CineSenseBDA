today I'm very happy to share with you the tips of how to do a 3 minute presentation in 3 minutes now first of all we must start with what I call the wife that is exactly important because worldwide means that is the message you have for the audience once we decide on that then that we can decide on what to say and of course more importantly the audience would be important because what are you going to see much kind of match the interest and was in it for the audience now some other thing you probably ask will be would that also be relevant to be talking about where and when now it's relevant say for example if you're going to deliver a speech after dinner you probably would like everything to go a bit lighthearted and where depending on the on the venue that you're going to do your presentation so all that are relevant now how is what I'm going to explain to you how we're going to do this 3 minute presentation I would like to introduce you I call the fish strip method look here right now this is what I call the opening and this is what I call the body and of course it tail is what I call the conclusion if I make right here is the second question this is the opening the opening the conclusion somehow will match with your wife you have message for the audience but this is how you start with the opening and conclusion for example you want to go green so obviously we say something on what I'm going to talk about in the opening and the conclusion of course you like to recap what you have said in your switch so as you leave the audience are very clear message that they get to come now in the body hear this is how you elaborate your points the point is to be story about this what and how this is exactly what you needed so this is about the body so 1 2 3 I called lot 3 times you have your wife repeated hair so this is how you prepare speech wouldn't be difficult once it clear to the Y and you use a kind of story approach to tell about what repeat the message three times people are going to get it
