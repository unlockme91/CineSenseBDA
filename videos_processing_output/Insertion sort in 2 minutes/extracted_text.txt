today we're going to learn insertion sort let's dive right in we're given this array and we want it sorted in increasing order here's what we're going to do we'll start at the left and work our way to the right examining each item and comparing it to the items on its left well then insert it in the correct position in the array you'll notice that part of our array will be sorted as we progress will Mark those items with the green background Let's Begin and you'll see what I mean we started to of course there are no items to the left of two so we mark it as sorted moving on to 8 we compare it to 2 and leave it where it is our first two items are now sorted next we have five which we can see that a place we know it needs to be after 2 so we swap it with 8 our first three items are now sorted on to three again it's out of place we swap it with 8 and 5 until it's in the correct position 9 and I'm sure you can see that it's in the correct spot let's move to four and insert it in the correct place in the array and that's it we're done insertion sort is one of the most straightforward sorting algorithms for your reference here's the pseudo code insertion sort has the worst case time complexity of big O event squared where n is the size of the Array for example when a race starts and decreasing order you need to swap and compare every single item which leads to big ol event squared thank you for watching I love it if you subscribe please post suggestions for future videos below
