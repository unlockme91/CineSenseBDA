probably the world's simplest idea I call it the Golden circle this little idea explains why some organisations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't every single person every single organisation on the planet knows what they do 100% some know how they do it but very very few people who organisations know why they do what they do by why I mean what's your purpose what's your cause what's your belief and why should anyone care the inspired leaders in the inspire awe inspired organisations all think act and communicate from the Inside Out let me give you an example if apple we're like everyone else a marketing message from them might sound like this we make great computers they're beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly want to buy one that's how most marketing is done that's how most sales done we say what we do we say how we're different or how we better and we expect some sort of behaviour or purchase a vote something like that here's how apple actually communicates everything we do we believe in challenging the status Quo we believe in thinking differently the way we challenge the status Quo is by making our products beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly want to buy one people don't buy what you do people buy why you do it the goal is not to do business with anybody with everybody who needs what you have the goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe again the goal is not just a cell people who need what you have the goals to sell to people who believe what you believe if you hire people just because they can do a job they'll work for your money but if you hire people who believe what you believe they work for you with blood and sweat and tears something called the law of diffusion of innovation the first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators the next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters the next 34% are your early majority you're late majority and your laggards but if you want mass market success or mass market acceptance of an idea you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18% market penetration so it's this here this little gap that you have to close because you see the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first and these guys the innovators in the early adopters they're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available these Are The People Who stun online for 6 hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out leaders hold the position of power or authority but those who lead inspire us and it's Those Who start with Y that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them thank you very much
